# How I built it

- ⚡️ [Astro](https://astro.build/), [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) - always fast
- 🎨 [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- 🌍 Localization with Astro i18n plus lightweight helpers in `src/i18n`
- 💪 [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), of course
- ☁️ Deploy on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
